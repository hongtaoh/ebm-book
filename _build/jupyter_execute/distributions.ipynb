    ">The model assumes that a disease progresses according to a set of events $E_1, \\ldots, E_N$, where $N$ is the number of biomarkers. Our goal is to estimate an ordering $S \\in \\sigma(N)$ over the events, which is a permutation of size $N$. The value of biomarker marker $n$ for patient $j$ is $X_{nj} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, which is a real-valued number. Each person $j$ has a corresponding Bernoulli random variable $d_j \\in \\{0,1\\}$, which denotes whether they have the disease or not (Note this is generally observed for these models, but I am including it for completeness). For person $j$ (assumed to have the disease to simplify notation), $k_n \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N\\}$ denotes their current disease stage. Let $\\theta_n$ denote the parameters for the distribution of biomarker $n$ when it is diseased and $\\phi_n$ be the corresponding parameters for when it is healthy."
