    ">The sampler for the biomarker ordering can be a bit tricker. The simplest way to do it might be to do a Metropolis-Hastings step where you select two indicies and propose swapping their order. Then you can work out the relative probabilities, evaluate and then accept/reject based on that. It's not the fastest sampler, but it is a lot more straightforward than some ways of doing it.  \n",

    "In the following, we assume we know the actual $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ values. Other than those, we know nothing except for participants' observed biomarker values. And we want to estimate the current order in which different biomarkers are affected by the disease in question. "
